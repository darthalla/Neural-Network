# Neural Network Draws

The idea of our project is to introduce you to neural networks.

Neural networks are not scary. They can process huge amounts of data and do the kind of work that humans cannot do. And also, just like us, trained neural networks can create paintings, write music, come up with essays.

We became particularly interested in how neural networks can visualize text. To make the project more interesting we decided to riddle neural networks with some metaphorical quotations from literature, and we invite you to visit our exhibition of neural network paintings.
